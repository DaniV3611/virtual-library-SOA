## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Enhanced Payment Response

```python
# Added payment_id to order payment response
return {
    "id": order.id,
    "user_id": order.user_id,
    "total_amount": order.total_amount,
    "status": order.status,
    "created_at": order.created_at,
    "payment_id": str(payment_record.id),  # NEW: For frontend navigation
    "items": [...]
}
```

#### 2. Updated Schema

```python
class OrderDetails(BaseModel):
    id: uuid.UUID
    user_id: uuid.UUID
    total_amount: float
    status: str
    created_at: datetime
    payment_id: str = None  # NEW: Optional payment ID
    items: list[dict] = []
```

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. PaymentModal Enhancements

```typescript
// Enhanced notification system
if (response.status === "completed") {
  toast.success("🎉 Payment completed successfully!", { duration: 4000 });

  // Auto-redirect to invoice
  if (response.payment_id) {
    setTimeout(() => {
      navigate({ to: `/profile/payments/${response.payment_id}` });
    }, 2000);

    toast.success("Redirecting to invoice in 2 seconds...", { duration: 2000 });
  }
}
```

#### 2. Payment History Table

```tsx
// Added Order button alongside View button
<div className="flex gap-2 justify-center">
  <Button
    variant="outline"
    size="sm"
    onClick={() => handleViewPayment(payment.id)}
  >
    <FaEye className="w-3 h-3 mr-1" />
    View
  </Button>
  <Button
    variant="ghost"
    size="sm"
    onClick={() => navigate({ to: `/profile/orders/${payment.order_id}` })}
  >
    <FaReceipt className="w-3 h-3 mr-1" />
    Order
  </Button>
</div>
```

#### 3. Invoice Page

```tsx
// Enhanced View Order button with icon
<Button
  variant="outline"
  size="sm"
  onClick={() => navigate({ to: `/profile/orders/${payment.order_id}` })}
  className="w-full mt-2 flex items-center gap-2"
>
  <FaReceipt className="w-3 h-3" />
  View Order Details
</Button>
```
